        The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
        methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can
        inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in
        order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use
        Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern
        language.
